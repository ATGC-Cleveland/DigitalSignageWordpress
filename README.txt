Digital signage with Wordpress. It's pretty plugin dependent, but very customizable.

The entire screen is filled with carousel that, using @malsup's jQuery Cycle Plugin, displays a single post for 18 seconds at a time. There's also a dock at the bottom of the page with four dynamic sidebars that are driven by jCarouselLite.
