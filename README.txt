digital signage with wordpress

When the president of the Chicago campus of The Chicago School of Professional Psychology asked for flatscreen televisions to be hung by each of the elevators and in gathering spaces, most people thought the difficult part would be getting a good price on the TVs.

You won’t be able to afford digital signage technology.

The school is also host to an international institute that focuses on marketing messages; specifically digital signage. They were thrilled that the school was going to jump onto the technology, but were stuck on the cost of existing platforms.

The real challenge was dropped on my plate at the end of a status meeting. I was pumped!

“The flatscreens are happening. Can you design a layout? And make it sustainable to manage?”


I turned to wordpress
But I knew it needed a strict structure, people couldn’t be expected to adhere on their own.

The entire screen is filled with carousel that, using @malsup’s jQuery Cycle Plugin, displays a single post for 18 seconds at a time. There’s also a dock at the bottom of the page with four dynamic sidebars that are driven by jCarouselLite.
